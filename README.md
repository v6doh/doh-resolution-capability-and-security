Our research focuses on the large-scale measurement and analysis of DNS over HTTPS (DoH) deployments, particularly within IPv6 networks. By conducting extensive measurements over a nine-month period in 2024, we have compiled the most comprehensive list of DoH servers to date, strictly adhering to RFC 8484 standards. Our findings reveal a significant increase in active IPv6 DoH servers, with numbers reaching 37 times greater than those discovered in studies from 2021 to 2022. However, we identify prevalent misconfigurations among these servers, likely due to administrative oversight or the use of private servers. Notably, nearly half of the responses to DoH recursive queries originate from non-recursive servers, the majority are DoH non-recursive referral servers from Microsoft. Additionally, other DoH recursive servers which fail to return domain resolution results, mainly are malfunctioning DoH recursive servers from Akamai. Our analysis of DoH response headers, DNS response headers, and DNS payloads highlights issues such as abnormal response headers, packet payload anomalies, and improper caching strategies. Based on these measurements, we propose potential improvements for enhancing the resolution capabilities and security of future DoH servers.
